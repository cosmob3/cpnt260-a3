TODO: **Working on Gallery**
- X Add Nav. bar and Footer
- X Nav. must be responsive
- X Single column on mobile, 3+ columns on desktop
- X Semantic images using figure and figcaption
  - X figcaption should include title or image description and photo credit
  - X fig-caption should have a min-width to preserve line length
- X Images should use img tag and have proper alt text
  - X note, if you use any functional images (such as links), then the alt text should describe the function and not the picture
- X Preserve image aspect ratio

Worked on my Gallery Page last night and got all of my images ready to start moving them around

Have completely change my images. I've been trying to make everything fit nicely but I'm having a really hard time getting it to do so

Got things lined up a bit. Used the Inspector tool and it really helped to figure out what was doing what. 

*Need to get better at using it*

The Inspector tool helped to see what was doing what and I realized part of my CSS was messing with the layout I was trying to do. Deleted `align-item: center;`
and it helped with the smaller images to make them a bit bigger.

Went for a different approach on the gallery. It looks more like steps going up and down and I really liked the way it looked

Almost forgot `Figcaptions`

FINSISHED TIME TO SUBMIT
